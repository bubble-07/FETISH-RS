**F**unctional **E**mbedding of **T**erms **I**n a **S**patial **H**ierarchy

A library for an active research project which implements a small, yet
extensible interpreter for a simply-typed combinator-based language,
along with a mechanism for deriving _embeddings_ (in the machine learning sense)
for terms of each type in the language. 

For starting points on this library, see the Rustdoc on [`crate::context::Context`] and 
[`crate::interpreter_and_embedder_state::InterpreterAndEmbedderState`]

For a description of what exactly is implemented, see

Please notify ajg137@case.edu if you would like to contribute to this research project, 
and we can arrange for an initial conversation.
